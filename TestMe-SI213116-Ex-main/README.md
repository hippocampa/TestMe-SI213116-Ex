# Searching for a name, even with typos!

Have you ever wanted to count how many times a name appears in an attendance list, but the name on your list might have some typing errors (typo)?
Then this project is the answer!

This project is made using Python3.12, with the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

# Installation

## Install Package

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) as the _package manager_. Install the project by using:

```bash
poetry init
```

## Activate Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment **after** you install the _package_. Activation can be done through:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Run Program

Before you can run the program, change your directory to `codetestdemo`.
You can run the program by using the command:

```bash
poetry run main.py
```

or manually (assuming the _virtual environment_ is active), run:

```bash
python main.py
```

# Todo

Here are some things you can do:

- Try to change the `.txt` file that is used
- Do unittest
